# Letter Distribution REACT App

This project creates a simple web app using [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material UI](https://mui.com/core/) to count letters in a string. In this web app, a user enters a string in a text field in a first page, and then the app calculates the distribution of letters in the string. This is then displayed in a table, alongside the expected distribution of letters (based on the frequency of each letter in the English language) and the percent difference. 

## Contents

 - **README.md**

 - **LICENSE**: this project is under the MIT license. See inside for more info. 

 - **letter-distribution**: this folder contains the REACT app named "letter-distribution". If you're new to REACT, the source code for this application is in **letter-distribution/src**, and in particular in the **App.js**, **InputForm.js**, **DisplayLetters.js**, and **PageHeader.js** files. 

## Usage

As of 20 August 2022, this web app has not been deployed anywhere. Therefore, if you want to see what it does, you will have to run it locally. 

To run this, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, with the Node Package Manager (NPM). With a terminal open in the letter-distribution directory, first install the required packages with the following command:

```
npm install
```

From there, run the following command to start the server on localhost: 

```
npm start
```

A new browser tab should open on your computer automatically, but if not, the terminal output should list some URLs to connect to the web app.

## Personal Note

This project was my way of flexing my REACT skills after going through a few tutorials online. (I recommend the series by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d), though as is typical of front-end development, his section on REACT's router library is already somewhat outdated.) This project was also a way for me to dip my toes into the Material UI library, as I will be likely be using it in an upcoming job. I don't expect this app itself to have much practical use, but it's nice to have in my portfolio.
